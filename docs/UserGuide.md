# SLAM User Guide
Welcome to **SLAM**! **SLAM** is a desktop application for student group leaders in NUS to manage their group events, tasks, members and various activities. This application allows you to effectively plan and manage the organisation of events by allowing users to create and add such events to their schedule. Leading up to the actual date and time of the event, committee heads can add tasks (e.g. meetings, purchase of logistics) to complete under each event to keep track of progress. Group members can also be added and assigned to these tasks. This application uses a Command Line Interface (CLI); that is, the application is operated by typing commands into a Command Box.

## 5. Task Commands
This section contains the available commands for managing tasks for events in **SLAM**. Because all tasks belong to a specific event in your catalog, an event must first be selected ([see Section 4.2 on Selecting Events](#42-select-an-event)) before any of the below commands can be used.

```
After pressing `enter` for the last time, you have keyed in your description, event and member(s). You have successfully added a task into **SLAM**! 

### 5.2 Select a Task

```
```
This member has been removed: JOHN DOE
